If your working directory is myfolder/homework/, what relative path would you specify to get the file located at myfolder/MyData.csv? \"\"~/MyData.csv\"\n\n#2. What are the major benefits of using R projects? R projects allow users to write code faster (as well as collaborate with others easily).\n\n#3. What is git and what is github? According to a source, Git is defined as a \"free-source version control system\", which developers install on the computer, to keep track of changes and modifications to their files. GitHub is described as \"cloud-based hosting service\" that allows the users to manage their Git Repositories.\n\n#4. What are the two main differences between a tibble and a data.frame? Tibble is a form of a data.frame, but used in the tidyverse().\n\n\n#Species %&gt;%\n#arrange(filter(select(as_tibble(iris) %&gt;%\n                        #starts_with(\"Petal\"), Species %&lt;% \n                        #Petal.Length &lt;1.55\n\n#Task 2 Reading Delimited Data\n\n#Task 2 Reading Delimited Data\n\n\n#glassdata &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/glass.data\")\n\n\n# Newly created variables are available immediately\n#glassdata %&gt;%\n  #select(type_of_glass) %&gt;%\n  #c('1' - 'building_windows_float_processed', '2' - 'building_windows_non_float_processed', '3' - 'vehicle_windows_float_processed', '4' - 'vehicle_windows_non_float_processed', '5' - 'containers', '6' - 'tableware', '7' - 'headlamps') %&gt;%\n     #Fe &lt; 0.2 %&gt;%\n       #Glass %in% c(\"Tableware\",\"Headlamps\")\n\n\n#yeast &lt;- read.csv(\"https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/yeast.data\")\n\n\n#yeast %&gt;%\n   #subset(yeast, select = c(seq_name, nuc)) %&gt;%\n     #meanmcg &lt;- mean(mcg), medianmcg &lt;- median(mcg), meangvh &lt;- mean(gvh), mediangvh &lt;- median(gvh), meanalm &lt;- mean(alm), medianalm &lt;- (median(alm), meanmit &lt;- mean(mit), medianmit &lt;- median(mit), meanerl &lt;- mean(erl), medianerl &lt;- median(erl), meanpox &lt;- mean(pox), medianpox &lt;- median(pox), meanvac &lt;- mean(vac), medianvac &lt;- median(vac)), (across(v1:v2))\n\n#Task 3: Combining Excel and Delimited Data\n\n#Task 3: Combining Excel and Delimited Data\n\n\n#install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n#install.packages(\"readxl\")\n#library(xlsx)\n#library(readxl)\n\n\n#whitewine &lt;- read_excel(path = \"white-wine.xlsx\", sheet = \"white-wine\")\n\n\n#read_excel(path = \"white-wine.xlsx\", sheet = \"variables\")\n#whitewine$white &lt;- c(\"white\"\")\n\n\n#redwine &lt;- read.csv('https://www4.stat.ncsu.edu/~online/datasets/red-wine.csv')\n\n\n#wines &lt;- dplyr::bind_rows(redwine, whitewine) \n\n\n#wines %&gt;%\n  #quality &gt; 6.5 %&gt;%\n  #alcohol &lt; 132 %&gt;%\n  #arrange(wines, desc(quality)) %&gt;%\n  #mydat[, c('acid', 'alcohol', 'type', 'quality')) %&gt;%\n    #mean &lt;- mean(alcohol) %&gt;%\n      #stdev &lt;- stdev(alcohol)"
